Thanks already for your intention to upload a bug report!

It is assumed you started the game as described at
[Launch on Steam](https://richelbilderbeek.github.io/conquer_chess/launch_on_steam/),
i.e. you launch the game using the 'Legacy Runtime 1.0'.

Please describe the bug, so that it can be reproduced.

If the bug involved a crash of the game, please upload the file
`~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/conquer_chess/conquer_chess_error.txt`,
as it contains the error message.
