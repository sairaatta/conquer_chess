# Reporting an in-game bug
  
Conquer Chess has bugs that happen when the game is running.

If the game crashes, the error log can be found
in the Conquer Chess folder. There are two options where this file is,
depending on how you installed Steam, shown below.
Please attach this error file in your
bug report.
