# Help as an audio artist

Audio is an important part of a game.

However,
[the songs of Conquer Chess](https://github.com/richelbilderbeek/conquer_chess/tree/main/resources/songs)
and
[the sound effects of Conquer Chess](https://github.com/richelbilderbeek/conquer_chess/tree/main/resources/sound_effects)
are just placeholders and not intended to be in the final version.

You can help by:

- sharing your ideas on audio
